# Sequence-analyzer
- This is a Python program that analyzes a DNA sequence by calculating nucleotide frequencies, GC content, and identifying repeated DNA motifs. The analysis results are saved to an Excel file, and a histogram plot of nucleotide frequencies is displayed.

## Features
- Calculates nucleotide frequencies (A, T, G, C) in the DNA sequence.
- Calculates GC content (percentage of G and C nucleotides) in the DNA sequence.
- Identifies repeated DNA motifs of lengths 2 to 5 nucleotides.
- Saves analysis results to an Excel file.
- Generates and displays a histogram plot of nucleotide frequencies.
## Usage
- Run the script dna_sequence_analyzer.py in a Python environment.

- Enter a DNA sequence containing only the characters 'A', 'T', 'G', and 'C' when prompted.

- The program will display nucleotide frequencies, GC content, identified DNA motifs, and generate a histogram plot.

- The analysis results, including the histogram plot, will be saved to an Excel file named dna_sequence_analysis.xlsx.
